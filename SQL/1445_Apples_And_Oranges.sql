This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the difference between number of apples and oranges sold each day.

Return the result table ordered by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

The query result format is in the following example:

 
Input:-
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |

| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+
